Binquan Guo received the B.S. degree and the master's degree in telecommunication engineering from Xidian University, Xi’an, China, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi’an, under the guidance of [Prof. Hongyan Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/hyli/) (2020.9 ~ ). He is also a Visiting Ph.D. student in University of Houston hosted by [Prof. Pan Miao](http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~mpan2/) (remotely) and Singapore University of Technology and Design under the guidance of [Prof. Zehui Xiong](https://sites.google.com/view/zehuixiong) (2024~). His research interests include job scheduling, network slicing, graph theory, routing and resource allocation algorithms. His research works can be found in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NA8egm4AAAAJ) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Binquan-Guo/research).
